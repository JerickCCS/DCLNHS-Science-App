          <div class="title">Basic Concepts of Motion</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Motion is a fundamental concept in physics that helps us understand how objects change their positions relative to other objects or reference points. A reference point is any point in space that we use to compare or measure the position and motion of other things.</p>
      <p>There is motion when you move toward or away from a reference point. Imagine you are walking to school from home. There are different paths that you could take. Each path adds up to the total distance from your house to your school. Your house is your reference or starting point, and your school is the final position.</p>
      <p>The origin (0, 0) is usually the reference point within a Cartesian Coordinate System. This system is divided into four distinct quadrants, denoted as I, II, III, and IV. These quadrants delineate the positioning of both x- and y-values, discerning their signs in relation to each quadrant's boundaries.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- Card 2 -->
      <p>In the previous chapter, we already introduced the four cardinal directions-north (N), south (S), east (E), and west (W)-as fundamental conventions utilized in a Cartesian plane. The positive directions are north and east, while the south and west are the negative ones.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Talking about motion, we look at simple ideas like how far and how fast things go, and how they change speed. The fundamental concepts of motion, such as time, distance or displacement, and speed or velocity, will help us determine how things move.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the concept of motion has applications in other scientific domains, such as biology, chemistry, and Earth science. For instance, some processes, such as diffusion, osmosis, and active transport, help in the movement of molecules and ions within cells.</p>
      <p>Understanding motion also aids in predicting the reaction rates and products since atoms and molecules rearrange to form a new substance in chemical reactions. Weather patterns and long-term climates can be determined through the motion of air masses and ocean currents.</p>

      <!-- Card 6 -->
      <p>When you are on the move, you travel a certain distance. But when you return to where you started, even though you have covered that same distance, your displacement is zero.</p>
      <p>Distance (d) denotes the length of the path taken by a moving object. On the other hand, displacement (d or Δd) is the shortest span between the initial and final positions. Delta (Δ) means "change." It is the difference between the final and initial values of any physical quantity.</p>
      <p>Distance is a scalar quantity, while displacement is a vector quantity. Distance, a scalar quantity, solely takes magnitude into account. Displacement, a vector quantity, not only encompasses magnitude, but also considers the direction of the movement.</p>
    </div>
    `,`
    <div>
      <!-- Card 7 -->
      <p>Measuring how far you have traveled along the whole path in any way you went or turned is distance. Displacement measures the shortest path from where you began to where you ended up. It also includes how far you moved and the direction you moved in.</p>
      <p>The fundamental unit of length in the International System of Units (SI) is the meter (m), which serves as a standard for measuring both distance and displacement. While the meter is applicable to quantifying the extent of travel, displacement goes further by incorporating directionality and, at times, utilizing positive or negative values to signify the motion's orientation.</p>
    </div>
    `,`
    <div>
      <!-- Card 8 -->
      <p>Other common units of length include inches (in), feet (ft), centimeters (cm), kilometers (km), and miles (mi).</p>
      <p>For example, consider the scenario where you take steps toward the east, traversing a path spanning 100 meters. Here, the distance covered is precisely 100 meters; correspondingly, the displacement is recorded as 100 meters, east. This displacement value encapsulates not only the extent, but also the directional context of your motion. Try to draw the situation.</p>
    </div>
    `,`
    <div>
      <!-- Card 9 -->
      <p>Now, if you retrace your steps and head westward, ultimately returning to your initial starting point, the cumulative distance covered becomes 200 meters. However, in terms of displacement, the value reduces to zero. In essence, a displacement of zero is achieved when the starting and ending positions coincide. Try to draw the situation.</p>
      <p>To better understand how distance differs from displacement, consider an athlete who runs from point A to point C, stops, then reverses his run to point B, and stops again (figure 8-1). The distance he covered is 60 m; however, his displacement is only 20 m. His displacement is positive since his direction is to the right (east)</p>

      </div>
      <p>When moving along the road, you can move at the same speed, speed up, or slow down, depending on the situation. When you are late for an appointment, you usually speed up to cover a greater distance at a lesser time of travel.</p>
      <p>When you encounter a yellow or red traffic signal along the way, you need to slow down in order to stop within the stopping distance to avoid any traffic law violation. When you drive around a curved path, it is better to slow down instead of speeding up in order to avoid accidents. These are some situations showing varying speeds or velocities.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <!-- Card 18 -->
      <p>Speed (v), a scalar quantity, is defined as the distance (d) traveled divided by time (t). In symbols, this is expressed as:</p>
      <p>speed (v) = d/t</p>
      <p>Velocity (v), a vector quantity, is the displacement (d or Δd) over time (t). The speed in a particular direction is also called velocity. In symbols, this is expressed as:</p>
      <p>velocity (v) = Δd/Δt</p>
      <p>v = (d<sub>f</sub> - d<sub>i</sub>) / (t<sub>f</sub> - t<sub>i</sub>)</p>

      <p>Given that the SI units for length are meter (m) and second (s), respectively, it follows that we can express speed and velocity using the unit meter per second (m/s). Moreover, velocity can carry additional information, such as a particular direction, or, in certain instances, positive or negative values indicating the motion's orientation.</p>

      <p>So, if we only look at the speed, it is 109 km/h but considering the direction, the car is moving at 109 km/h north. When the instantaneous speed is coupled with the direction of travel, it transforms into the instantaneous velocity.</p>
