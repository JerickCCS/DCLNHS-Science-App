      <p>How Are Earthquakes Measured?
Seismograph measuring earthquake
Earthquakes vary in strength—some earthquakes are too weak to be noticed, while others are so strong that they cause catastrophic damage. To describe the size and degree of shaking caused by an earthquake, the terms intensity and magnitude are used.</p>

    <p>Intensity of an Earthquake
Earthquake intensity scale
Intensity refers to the perceptible strength of an earthquake in a certain locality or area. It describes the effects or the amount of damage earthquakes has caused on people, infrastructures, natural objects, and land surfaces.</p>
<p>In 1996, PHIVOLCS adopted a 10-point intensity scale to replace the Rossi-Forel scale, which is one of the first seismic scales that describes the intensity of an earthquake. The adopted scale, called the PHIVOLCS Earthquake Intensity Scale (PEIS), categorizes earthquakes from scarcely perceptible (I) to completely devastating (X).</p>

    <p>Whereas intensity is a descriptive measure, magnitude is a quantitative measure of an earthquake's strength. The magnitude of an earthquake refers to the amount of energy released. This is determined from the amplitude of the surface waves recorded by a seismometer, a device that detects and records ground motions caused by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>

    <p>The quantitative measure for earthquake magnitude is called the Richter scale (table 10–2), devised by American seismologist Charles Francis Richter. It is a logarithmic scale where an increase of one unit on the Richter scale is roughly equal to a tenfold increase in measured amplitude. For example, the wave amplitude of a magnitude 7 earthquake is 10 times greater than magnitude 6, and 100 times greater than magnitude 5. The energy released by an earthquake increases about 30 times with each step of the scale.</p>

          <p>•<strong>Ground shaking</strong> is the main cause of destruction during an earthquake. Vibrations may cause tall buildings to collapse, roads and railroad tracks to break, electric posts to topple, water pipes to dislodge, dams to fail, and landslides to occur.</p>

    <p>The tsunami that hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on September 28, 2018 shows the destruction that tsunamis can cause. This tsunami, triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, caused water to smash buildings and houses, killing more than 400 people and badly injuring another 400. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the mountainous region of Donggala Regency in the Central Sulawesi Province of Indonesia. The earthquake was triggered by the movement of the Palu-Koro fault which is 20 kilometers deep.</p>

    <p>For a tsunami to be formed, an earthquake of great magnitude must have occurred. Earthquakes of magnitude between 6.5 and 7.5 do not usually produce tsunamis. Earthquakes of magnitude 7.9 and greater might produce destructive local tsunamis near the epicenter.<p>

    <p>The source of energy should be big enough and close enough to the ocean floor. The energy of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake is equivalent to about 6,270,000 tons of TNT explosives. Most tsunamis are generated by earthquakes less than 100 kilometers below the Earth's surface.</p>

    <p>The energy from such an earthquake causes the ocean floor to rise or fall, triggering a tsunami. Volcanic eruption under the ocean, submarine landslides or landslides in the mountains carrying a big volume of debris to the ocean can also cause tsunamis. Large meteorite plunging into the Ocean may also cause tsunamis.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>In a tsunami, waves move outward in all directions away from the source. A tsunami is formed as the displaced water moves under the influence of gravity. The wavelength of the tsunami is very large.<p>

    <p>As the wave moves closer to the shore where the depth of the ocean floor is less, the wave is compressed so the wavelength is shortened. Wave energy is directed upward causing the height of water to dramatically increase.</p>

    <p>Wave energy is directed upward causing the height of water to dramatically increase. The height of the water generally reach up to about 30 m above sea level, but can also be as high as 600 m.</p>
