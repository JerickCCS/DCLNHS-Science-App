      <p>A Closer Look at the Cell</p>
      <p>Is life possible without the cell?</p>
      <p>Cells are microscopic units that collectively carry out the processes that make an organism a living entity. Your body is composed of trillions of cells of around 200 different types. Your brain is made up of brain cells, your skeleton of bone cells, and your heart of cardiac muscle cells.</p>
      <p>The discovery of cells changed the way scientists study living organisms. Up to the early 1600s, people only knew of organisms that they could see with the unaided eye. They had no knowledge of the existence of microscopic life-forms.</p>

      <p>Scientists consider Robert Hooke and his early contemporaries to have paved the way for the development of modern biology. Hooke used an early microscope like the one shown in figure 4-3 to examine a thin slice of cork from a mature tree. He observed tiny, box-shaped structures which he called cellulae, meaning "small room" in Latin; hence the term. What Hooke actually observed were the cell walls of dead plant cells, which are components of the cork. The simplicity of his instrument limited his work, but scientists who came after him succeeded in unraveling the intricate design of a living cell.</p>

      </div>
      <p>In 1839, German botanist Matthias Schleiden and German physician Theodor Schwann formulated the cell theory, which states that all living things are made up of cells. German physician Rudolf Virchow also contributed to this theory. He stated that new cells came from preexisting cells. The classical cell theory formulated by Schleiden, Schwann, and Virchow is the foundation of modern biology.</p>
      <p>Modern molecular biology has added many principles to cell theory. These are:</p>
      <p>1. Energy flows within cells.</p>
      <p>2. Cells contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is passed on from a parent cell to the daughter cells during cell division.</p>
      <p>3. All cells have basically the same chemical composition and metabolic activities.</p>

      </div>
      <p>There are two main types of cell: prokaryotic and eukaryotic which is shown on figure 4-4. Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane bound organelles. An example of a prokaryotic cell is a bacterium. Bacteria are among the earliest life-forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. They play significant roles in nutriment cycles in the environment. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, have both a nucleus and membrane-Bound organelles. Structurally, eukaryotic cells are more complex than prokaryotic cells.</p>
      <p>Eukaryotic cells can be found in unicellular organisms like protozoa and multicellular organisms made up of many cells which include some examples of fungi, some protists, plants, and animals.</p>

      <p><strong>Plantlike Protists</strong></p>
      <p>Plantlike protists, or algae, are diverse and widely distributed. They range from single celled to colonial and multicellular forms. Algae are not considered plants since they do not have structures that protect their reproductive cells. They are not classified as animals either because they do not move using appendages.

      <p>Some phytoplankton are classified as protists. Phytoplankton (figure 4-7a) are unicellular photosynthetic organisms that float on the surface of freshwater and saltwater. These organisms are responsible for 50% to 85% of the oxygen in the atmosphere. Other examples of plantlike protists are dinoflagellates, Euglena (figure 4-7b), diatoms, and golden-brown algae. which are ecologically classified as primary producers in aquatic habitats.</p>

      <p>Dinoflagellates are also plantlike protists. They are named such due to the presence of two flagella in each cell. They are similar to Euglena, but are mostly found in marine environments. Under certain conditions, dinoflagellates can grow or bloom rapidly, turning water along coasts reddish brown. This phenomenon is commonly called red tide. A large dinoflagellate population produces large amounts of neurotoxins that harm marine organisms, as well as terrestrial organisms that feed on them.</p>
      <p><strong>Animallike Protists</strong></p>
      <p>Animallike protists or protozoans are heterotrophic, which means they depend on other organisms for food. Protozoans include the sarcodines (Amoeba in figure 4-8a), ciliates (Paramecium in figure 4-856), and zooflagellates (Trypanosoma in figure 4-8c).</p>

      <p>An Amoeba is one of the simplest known protozoans. It consists of a nucleus and all other cellular parts present in a eukaryotic cell. It "crawls" using its pseudopodia, or false feet, into which its cytoplasm flows. This is referred to as amoeboid movement, powered by a protein called actin. It also eats tiny food particles present in its surroundings using its pseudopodia. The food particles are enclosed by food vacuole, and are intracellularly digested through the help of enzymes from the lysosomes. Excess water is ejected through the contractile vacuole, which pulsates alternately with the radiating canals.</p>

      <p>Fungi are found in almost all types of environment. Fungi have eukaryotic cells with cell walls made of chitin, a structural polysaccharide also found in the exoskeletons of arthropods. They lack chlorophyll, and so they must procure their food from other sources, Most fungi are saprophytic. Some fungi may also obtain their nutrients through parasitism, as in the case of Septobasidium sp., a parasite of plants and insects. A few fungi are unicellular, while most are multicellular. Yeasts are examples of unicellular fungi that reproduce through budding Multicellular fungi, such as mushrooms (figure 4-9a), grow larger than yeasts Fungi and reproduce via spores.</p>

      <p>One of the most common types of fungi is the bread mold (figure 4-96). Its mycelium has several types of specialized hyphae. In moldy food, the horizontal hyphae grow across the surface of the food. A branching network of hyphae, called rhizoids, grows into the food. Bread molds can reproduce asexually by growing vertical hyphae. On top of these stalks, black spore cases called sporangium form. Inside each spore case are individual spores with one or more nuclei. They may be dispersed by several agents and can develop into a new mycelium.</p>

      <p>The Discovery of the Nucleus</p>
      <p>The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. However, the exact date of its discovery and the identity of the person who discovered it are still unverified, in 1802. Austrian botanical artist Franz Bauer sketched orchid cells and labeled their nucleus. In 1825, Czech physiologist Jan Evangelista Purkinje discovered the nucleus of a chicken oocyte and called it "vesicula germanitiva." Then in the 1830, Scottish botanist Robert Brown observed the nucleus of various plant cells and coined the term "nucleus," but in his time the function of the nucleus was not yet known. Instead, scientists focused on studying its location in the cell and its appearance. Later, the nucleus was deliberately observed and became a key principle in the creation of the cell theory. Scientists thought the nucleus was the only cell organelle until they discovered other organelles such as the Golgi bodies, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. This provided more insight into the nature and structure of cells. Due to advancements in biotechnology, the study of the cell nucleus has been brought to the nanoscale range, opening new frontiers in cell research and biotechnology.</p>

It is composed of membrane-bound structures called organelles, other cytoplasmic inclusions, and the semifluid portion called cytosol, where dissolved substances are suspended. The cytoplasm supports and suspends organelles and cellular molecules. Many cellular processes, including protein synthesis, also occur in the cytoplasm.</p>

      <p><strong>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): channel for transport</strong> - The ER is an interconnecting membranous network of vesicles, tubules, and flattened sacs. It serves as the quality control unit of the cell. There are two types of ER: rough and smooth. The rough ER is characterized by the presence of ribosomes (figure 4-12), where protein synthesis occurs. The smooth ER, on the other hand, does not have ribosomes. It is the site of lipid and steroid synthesis. Proteins made in the ER are either transported out from the cell in the form of secretory products or used by the other parts of the cell.</p>

Proteins from the ribosomes are chemically modified, packed, and sealed off in small packets called vesicles. These vesicles move from the ER to the Golgi bodies and are grouped into batches, either for export or for use by the cell. Just like the ribosomes. their abundance is relative to the cell's activity. Some cells can have only one large stack, whereas others can have hundreds or even thousands of Golgi bodies.</p>

      <p><strong>Peroxisome: detoxification of harmful compounds</strong> - Peroxisomes help the cell use oxygen. They produce the toxic hydrogen peroxide (H₂O) in the process, but contain enzymes that convert it into water and oxygen. When free radicals such as H₂O, build up in cells. peroxisomes release catalase, an enzyme that breaks down H₂O,. This reaction leaves behind harmless water and oxygen molecules. The liver and kidney cells are rich in peroxisomes that help remove toxins from the blood.</p>

      <p><strong>Centriole</strong>: for the formation of spindle fibers - Centrioles are rod-like structures composed of microtubules. They are found in pairs at right angles to each other, close to the nucleus of an animal cell. They are responsible for spindle formation during cell division. In this process, the spindle fibers pull chromosomes to the opposite poles of the cell.</p>
      <p><strong>Cell wall: for protection and covering</strong> - While the covering of an animal cell consists only of a cell membrane, a plant cell has both a cell membrane and a cell wall, which serve as its outermost part. The cell wall supports and defines the shape of plant cells. It also protects the cell from mechanical injury and invasion of microorganisms. There are holes all over the ell wall called plasmodesmata (sing. plasmodesma), which allow the transport of materials between cells.</p>

      <!-- Card 35 -->
      <p>Cell walls have two types-the cellulose-rich primary cell wall, which is formed just after ell division, and the thicker, more rigid secondary cell wall.</p>
      <p><strong>Cell junction: for cell connections</strong> - In plants, cells are linked from cell wall to cell wall by me middle lamella. In animals, cells are linked from cell membrane to cell membrane by cell junctions. There are three types of cell junction in animal cells.</p>
      <p>• Tight junctions occur between the cells of special types of tissue to prevent the entry of infective microorganisms and the leaking of acids in the tissues of the intestine.</p>
      <p>• Desmosomes hold two adjacent cells together at one point. Desmosomes hold together cells that are subjected to stretching, such as cells in the skin and heart tissues.</p>
      <p>• Gap junctions are small open channels that link the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. They provide rapid communication between cells.</p>
      <p>A small intestine cell junction consists of the three types of cell junction found in animal</p>

      <p><strong>Ribosome</strong>: protein factory Ribosomes may be free of attached, and single of in clusters These small round bodies are present in all cells. They are regarded as the sites of protein synthesis. They receive genetic information in the form of messenger RNA from the nucleus. They then translate the genetic information into amino acids that make up a protein molecule</p>
      <p><strong>Cytoskeleton</strong>: cellular strength and motility The framework of most cells consists of a network of intermediate filaments (figure 4-164), microtubules (figure 4-166), and microfilaments (figure 4-16c). Microtubules are hollow, cylindrical structures found in the cytoplasm. These structures facilitate the movement of chromosomes during cell division and help in the movement of secretory vesicles. Microfilaments are solid rod-like structures containing actin. They provide structural support and assistance in cell motility, such as in the case of Amoeba, and for allowing cell contraction in the muscle cell. Intermediate filaments are larger than microfilaments, but smaller than microtubules. These structures are not directly involved in cellular movement, they instead provide mechanical support to the cell.</p>

      <p>Procedures:</p>
      <p>1. Cook the gelatin as instructed</p>
      <p>2. Place the small plastic bag into the plastic container so that the open end of the plastic bag extends over the edge of the plastic container.</p>
      <p>3. Pour the gelatin into the plastic bag enough to fill it. Let it cool</p>
      <p>4. Before the gelatin hardens, insert the grape in the middle, and scatter some raisin on top of the gelatin randomly.</p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <p>1. What part is represented by the: plastic container, plastic bag, gelatin, grape, and raisins?</p>
      <p>2. Which cell part occupies most of the space pf the cell?</p>
