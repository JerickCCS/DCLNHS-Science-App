      </div>
      <p>Cell division is a very important process in an organism. It either makes an exact copy of a preexisting cell or an entirely different cell in terms of amount and variability of genetic material. Cells reproduce through two types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis produces identical cells that make growth and repair possible. Meiosis produces unique cells with half the normal number of genetic materials, and gives rise to sex cells or gametes that are involved in sexual reproduction. It is through meiosis and sexual reproduction that traits from the parents are passed on to their offspring.</p>

      <p>Once a cell is fully grown, it either stops growing or divides and produces more cells through cellular reproduction. In multicellular organisms, cellular reproduction gives the body the ability to grow and repair worn-out tissues. In unicellular organisms, on the other hand, cellular reproduction enables the production of identical copies of an individual organism.</p>
      <p>Cells follow a cycle of growth and division known as the cell cycle (figure 5-1). Every time a parent cell undergoes the cell cycle, it produces daughter cells. Therefore, the cell cycle always leads to an increased number of cells.</p>
    </div>
    `,`
    <div>
      <!-- Card 3 -->
      <p>There are two main stages in the cell cycle: interphase and mitotic phase (M phase). The interphase stage is longer than the mitotic phase. In a 24-hour cell cycle, almost 23 hours is spent for interphase, and only an hour for cell division. The completion of the whole cycle varies depending on the cell type. Some cells complete the cycle within minutes; others after several hours or even years. In the human body, most cells divide every 12 to 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Cell division refers to the process in which a cell (parent cell) divides to produce more cells (daughter cells). The nucleus of a cell plays a central role in cell division. It contains the chromosomes, which are threadlike molecular structures that carry hereditary information contained in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). During the synthesis phase of interphase, these chromosomes are replicated so that each daughter cell will have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.</p>
      <p>Aside from the nucleus, the microtubules and microfilaments also play key roles in cell division. Microtubules form spindle fibers that pull the sister chromatids (identical chromatids that are formed through the replication of a chromosome during the interphase) apart. Microfilaments aid in the division of the cytoplasm and formation of cell membranes in the daughter cells.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Scientists used to think that the interphase is simply a resting stage. Today, it is widely established that during interphase cells actively perform the majority of their functions. In addition, the materials needed for cell division are produced during this stage.</p>
      <p>The cell's chromosomes are in chromatin form during interphase. Chromatin is a thin fibrous form of DNA wound around proteins called histones. After interphase, the chromatin undergoes condensation, a process in which the chromatin becomes shorter and denser. Condensation is made possible by a protein complex called condensin, which is made of proteins that interact with one another. It triggers the tight coiling of the chromosomes into a pair of sister chromatids. Figure 5-2 shows an organizational diagram of the structure of a chromosome up to the DNA.</p>

      <!-- Card 5 -->
      <p>Interphase can be divided into three phases. The first phase is the first gap phase (G1 phase), which is the primary growth phase of the cell. It is also called the gap phase because it serves as the interval between cytokinesis and DNA synthesis. During the G1 phase, the cell grows and increases in size. Proteins are also synthesized and cell</p>
      <p>The second phase is the synthesis phase (S phase), in which the DNA of the cell, including the chromosomes, is replicated. Replication results in two identical structures called sister chromatids. Histones, a group of relatively small, basic proteins which form the core of the nucleosome, and other materials vital to the replication of chromosomes, are also formed during this phase. A nucleosome is a small, round structure consisting of a portion of DNA coiled around a cluster of histone protein molecules.</p>
      <p>The last phase is the second gap phase (G2 phase), which fills the gap between DNA synthesis. During the G2 phase, the cells synthesize organelles and other materials, many of which have specific roles in cell division.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Most of the cells in the body are constantly being replaced because they are dividing. Bone cells make new bone cells, and skin cells make new skin cells. Even at this moment, thousands of cells throughout your body are being replaced by new ones.</p>
      <p>Depending on the type of cell, some divide very fast (e.g., skin cells and red blood cells), while others divide less often (e.g., nerve cells and brain cells). Some cells, once formed, do not divide at all. In muscle cells, the nucleus divides but the cytoplasm does not. Skeletal muscle cells increase in size but do not divide; the muscles you had when you were a baby are still the ones you have now, only bigger.</p>
      <p>Not all cells divide in the same manner because there are different cell types. Multicellular organisms are made up of two basic cell types: somatic cells and germ cells. Somatic cells are essentially every cell in the body, such as brain and skin cells, with the exception of the germ cells. They are diploid cells, which means they contain two sets of chromosomes (2n). Germ cells are cells that produce the male and female gametes (sperm and egg). The gametes are haploid cells which contain a single set of chromosomes (n). In humans, somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes (2n), while gametes have 23 chromosomes (n). Diploid cells are produced through mitosis, while haploid cells are produced through meiosis. In unicellular organisms, such as the Paramecium, cells divide through binary fission.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Mitosis is a type of cell division in which two identical daughter cells are produced from a single parent cell. Mitosis involves four phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. At the end of telophase, two diploid cells containing the same set of chromosomes from the parent cell are produced.</p>
      <p>Cytokinesis is the physical division of the cytoplasm of a parent cell into two. This process occurs concurrently with the latter stages of mitosis. In animal cells, cytokinesis involves the formation of a cleavage furrow, which pinches off or divides the cell into two. In plants, instead of being cleaved, a cell plate forms between the two new nuclei. The cell plate enlarges and elongates until it merges with the cell walls, and eventually forms a new cell wall. Figure 5-7 on page 100 compares cytokinesis in an animal cell and a plant cell.</p>

      </div>
      <p>At the onset of life, a small region below the hindgut of the embryo serves as the location of the primordial germ cell. As an individual grows, the somatic cells of the embryo continuously divide through mitosis to form the body and its organs. These organs will remain dormant until the individual reaches puberty, when they will start to produce sex cells.</p>
      <p>When maternal and paternal chromosomes combine during fertilization, chromosomes with the same size and shape form pairs. These pairs are called homologous chromosomes or homologues, which have the same set of genes.</p>
      <p>Unlike mitosis, meiosis involves two cell divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II) and only one phase of DNA replication. The two cell divisions result in cells with a haploid number (n) of chromosomes. Note that in some species, a second interphase also occurs before meiosis II. However, DNA replication only occurs prior to meiosis I.</p>
