      <p>Observations and experimentations in science require skills
in measuring, collecting data, and reporting results. As a science
student, you need to learn how to take measurements correctly
and scientifically. The way you take measurements affects your
derivation or computation of other quantities that are useful in
your investigation.</p>
      <p>The measurements commonly taken in the laboratory are
length, mass, volume, and temperature.</p>

          <div class="title">Tools for Measuring Length</div>
      </div>
      
      <p>Length can be measured using simple tools such as the ruler, meter rule, and caliper.
A ruler is used to measure lengths of objects within 1-30 cm. Measurements in a ruler are
typically displayed in centimeters, millimeters, and inches. A ruler starts its measurement
from a position that is not at the edge of the zero mark.</p>
      <p>A meter rule is a long, straight stick that has a well-ground edge where you can begin
measuring (i.e., zero at the end of the meter rule). This feature ensures accuracy from the
starting point. The meter rule is commonly used in woodworking applications since it has
a length of one meter and displays measurements in centimeters, millimeters, and inches.
Figure 1-9 shows the difference between a ruler and a meter rule.</p>

    <div>
      <p>A caliper is used for measuring small lengths, such as the diameter of a circular object or
the thickness of a material, up to 0.01 millimeters (mm). It has jaws and a locking screw and
can be used to measure both external and internal dimensions of an object.</p>
      <p>To use a caliper, carefully grip the object using the straight edges of the external or internal jaws and secure it with the locking screw. Figure 1-10 shows a typical caliper.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Figure 1-11. The common types of balance</p>
      <p>A double beam balance is a mechanical weighing balance known for its precision and
durability. It is made up of two pans and two beams (bars) that support sliding weights or
riders. The first rider measures from 0 to 10 grams in l-g increments, while the second rider
measures from 0 to 200 grams in 10-g increments.</p>
    </div>
  `,`
    <div>
      <p>The double beam balance determines the difference in mass by placing the object to
be weighed on one pan and adding calibrated weights on the other pan. The riders are then
adjusted until equilibrium is reached, and the scale reading is determined by noting the
position of the riders, indicating the mass of the sample.</p>
      <p>Another mechanical weighing balance is the triple beam balance. It is made up of one
pan and three beams that support riders. The first rider measures from 0 to 100 grams with
10-g increments, the second rider measures from 0 to 500 grams in 100-g increments, and the
third rider from zero to 10 grams in 1-g increments. This balance accurately determines the
absolute mass of an object and can measure to the tenth of a gram.</p>
      <p>Before using the balance, the riders on the three beams must be moved to the leftmost
positions so that the scale pointer exactly aligns with the zero line. The object is then placed
on the pan, and the riders are adjusted until the scale pointer returns to zero. The hundreds
rider is adjusted first, followed by the tens and ones. The position of the riders corresponds to
the object's mass, which is obtained by summing the numbers from the three beams.</p>
    </div>
  `,`
    <div>
      <p>The top-loading balance and the analytical balance are both electronic balances
designed for high-precision measurements.</p>
      <p>Top-loading balances are commonly used in educational settings, quality control
laboratories, and general weighing stations. They are less precise than analytical balances,
typically providing measurements to two or three decimal places since they cannot measure
objects of extremely low masses. Top-loading balances are also typically more durable
and less susceptible to environmental conditions, making them suitable for everyday
weighing use.</p>
      <p>An analytical balance, on the other hand, has higher sensitivity and offers better
precision. It has an enclosed measuring pan to avoid dust and environmental elements, such
as wind, to affect and disrupt measurements. Depending on the model, analytical balances
have weighing capacities ranging from 0.001 g up to 200 g and readability of up to four
decimal places (0.0001 g), making them appropriate for weighing small quantities with high
accuracy. Thus, analytical balances are extensively utilized in scientific laboratories,
particularly in analytical chemistry, where accurate measurements are essential for studies
and experiments.</p>
      <p>The basic steps for weighing with analytical and top-loading balances are generally
similar. The only difference is that, in an analytical balance, the balance door is closed to
reduce the effect of wind and dust in the obtained measurement.</p>
    </div>
  `,`
    <div>
      <p>The following are the steps in using the two balances.</p>
      <p>1. Make sure the balance pan is empty, then press the "tare" or "zero" button.</p>
      <p>2. Place the object to be weighed at the center of the pan. If you are to weigh a wet sample or chemicals, do not place them directly on the pan. Instead, use a weighing dish to keep
the sample or chemical contained. Position the weighing dish in the center of the pan,
press "tare" to reset to zero, and add the sample. If you are using an analytical balance,
close the balance door.</p>
      <p>3. Record the displayed weight once the balance stabilizes.</p>

          <div class="title">Wares for Measuring Volume</div>
      </div>

      <p>In the laboratory, the volume of liquids can be measured using glasswares, such as those
shown in figure 1-12. Beakers are commonly used as reaction containers and for keeping
liquid or solid samples. Though these containers come in varying sizes and include volume
marks, it is important to note that these markings only provide approximate, not accurate,
measures of liquid volume.</p>
      <p>Graduated cylinders are used to approximate liquid volume measurements to the nearest
0.1 mL. They may also be used to transfer liquids with a considerable degree of accuracy.
Pipettes are used to transfer and measure liquids where a fixed and small volume is required,
providing a high degree of accuracy in measuring the liquid quantity. Burettes are particularly
used in titration experiments in quantitative chemistry for measuring and delivering a precise
volume of liquid to the nearest 0.01 ml or 0.l mL, depending on the capacity of the burette.
Burettes differ from pipettes because burettes can provide varied sample volumes.</p>

    <div>
      <p>In measuring the liquid volume using graduated cylinders, pipettes, and burettes, the
liquid level should be correctly read. Liquids tend to form a curvature called meniscus at the
liquid surface. For most liquids, an upward curvature is formed. To read their volume, make
sure the eye is at the same level as the bottom of the meniscus (figure 1-13). A white background
might occasionally help to clearly observe the meniscus.</p>

      <p>Other laboratory tools and equipment, such as aspirators and Bunsen burners, are also
frequently used in laboratory experiments. An aspirator is essential in transferring fluids.
It creates a vacuum by drawing air or liquid through a tube, which is usually a pipette.
Figure 1-14 shows how to properly use a pipette with the help of an aspirator.</p>

      </div>
      <p>1. Draw the liquid into the pipette using a rubber bulb or an aspirator.</p>
      <p>2. Drain the liquid down to the desired reading, touching the adhering drop to the side of
the container. Plug the upper hole of the pipette with your index finger to prevent the
liquid from draining further.</p>
      <p>3. Place the pipette tip against the side of the receiving container. Take your finger off the
top of the container to let the liquid flow. After emptying the pipette, allow for a 20 s
drainage period. Touch the tip of the pipette to the side of the container.</p>
      <p>The liquid remaining in the lower portion of the pipette should not be blown out.
The pipette has been calibrated for this amount to remain.</p>

      <p>Another laboratory equipment is the Bunsen burner,
which is used for heating and is fueled by liquified
petroleum gas (LPG). The Bunsen burner produces a
flame that can be adjusted based on the requirements of
an experiment. Named after its creator, Robert Bunsen,
this equipment can produce a bluish-green flame to an
orange-yellow flame.</p>
