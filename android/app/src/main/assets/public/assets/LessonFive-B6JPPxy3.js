            <div class="title">Lesson 5 Practical Examples of Solutions: Acids, Bases, and Salt Solutions</div>
        </div>
        <p>What are practical examples of solutions in everyday life?</p>
        <p>In your everyday activities, you often come across various types of solutions. For example, various household chemicals, like vinegar (a mixture of acetic acid and water) is used in cooking, while bleach (a solution of sodium hypochlorite) is used in disinfecting or cleaning. In Mini Lab 3-1, you get to prepare salt in a water mixture and observe that adding salt to water causes it to dissolve and form a solution. If sodium chloride is used in water, the resulting solution is a saline solution.</p>

            <div class="title">Acidic and Basic Solutions</div>
        </div>
        <p>You may be familiar with many common acids and bases. Acetic acid is the major component of vinegar; while vitamin C is ascorbic acid. Ammonia is the pungent base present in cleaning agents and disinfectants. Magnesium hydroxide and other bases compose antacids, medicines used to treat hyperacidity. While acids and bases have practical uses, their effects are not always beneficial.</p>
        <p>Acids and bases have distinct properties. Knowing these properties will help us distinguish and use these substances properly and appropriately. These substances are present in the different aspects of daily life—from the essential functions of the body systems to the use of cleaning products, medicines, and cosmetics.</p>

            <div class="caption">Figure 3-8. Acetic acid is a major component of vinegar.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Acids have the following general properties:</p>
        <p>• Acids taste sour. Acetic acid and lactic acid give sourness to vinegar and sour milk, respectively.</p>
        <p>• Acids cause a color change in plant dyes, which serve as acid-base indicators. They also turn blue litmus paper to red.</p>
    </div>
    `,`
    <div>
        <p>• Acids react to certain metals, such as calcium, magnesium, and iron, producing hydrogen gas.</p>
        <p>• Acids conduct electricity when in aqueous solutions. A solution of sulfuric acid in water can conduct electricity.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of acid solutions, commonly found in both home and school environments, that can react with litmus paper. Litmus paper is a strip of paper treated with a natural water-soluble dye that changes color depending on whether the substance it is soaked in is acidic or basic.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), also called oil of vitriol, is used to manufacture dyes, pigments, fertilizers, explosives, drugs, detergents, and inorganic salts and other acids. It is commonly found in a variety of cleaning products, including oven cleaners and toilet bowl cleaners. It is also used in petroleum refining and metallurgical processes. It is also used in schools, primarily in chemistry laboratories for titration experiments and solution preparations.</p>
        <p>Hydrochloric acid (HCl), also known as muriatic acid, is a solution of hydrogen chloride gas in water. It is commercially available as a concentrated solution of 36% HCl by mass. It is also utilized as a chlorinating agent and in the processing of some food products. It composes the gastric juice in the stomach that aids in the breakdown of food during digestion. Like sulfuric acid, it is commonly used in titration experiments and observation of solubility and gas evolution.</p>

        <p>Citric acid (HOC(CH₂CO₂H)₃) is a natural preservative that is commonly used in the kitchen, especially in baking and cooking. Citric acid may be found in citrus fruits like lemons and oranges, and it is also used in other forms of food preservation.</p>
        <p>Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), also called ethanoic acid, is a component of vinegar produced from the fermentation of natural carbohydrates. It is found in body fluids and plant juices. In industries, it is the primary material in the preparation of acetates, which are substances used in the production of plastics, photographic films, and textiles.</p>

        <p>In contrast, bases have the following distinct properties:</p>
        <p>• Bases taste bitter. The basic substances contained in ampalaya extract make it bitter.</p>
        <p>• Bases are slippery or soapy. This property is exhibited by soaps and detergents that contain bases.</p>
        <p>• Bases also cause color change in plant dyes. They change the color of red litmus paper to blue.</p>
        <p>• Bases, like acids, can also conduct electricity when in aqueous solutions.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Here are some examples of basic solutions, commonly found in both home and school environments, that can also react with litmus paper.</p>
        <p>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), commonly called caustic soda or lye, is the most widely used base. The solution of sodium hydroxide neutralizes acids in various chemical processes. Sodium hydroxide is a raw material in soap making. It is also used in schools primarily in chemistry laboratories for titration experiments and solution preparations.</p>
        <p>Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂), a white powder largely produced from seawater, is the primary source of magnesium metal. In water, it forms a suspension called milk of magnesia, which is used to relieve hyperacidity and constipation. It is also used in discussions about solubility and in explaining the behavior of sparingly soluble bases.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH), also called aqua ammonia, is a solution of ammonia gas in water. Ordinary household ammonia is a dilute ammonium hydroxide solution commonly used as a cleaning agent. An aqueous solution of ammonia is used as an inhalant (smelling salt) to prevent or treat fainting. The substance is also used as a primary material in the fertilizer industry.</p>

        <p>The aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) has a wide range of uses. It has medicinal uses and can be used as a gargle to help soothe sore throat or even in wound cleaning. A cutting-edge application features a water lamp that runs on a saline solution, allowing the energy produced to be used for charging a smartphone. Sports drinks are formulated as solutions, featuring a mix of dissolved salt, sugar, and various other ingredients blended seamlessly into water. This combination aims to provide hydration, replenish electrolytes, and offer a source of energy during physical activities.</p>

        <p>Magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄), or Epsom salt, is commonly used in bathwater to promote relaxation and provide relief for sore muscles. In chemistry laboratories, it is commonly used to study crystallization or as a component in specific chemical reactions.</p>
        <p>Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), or baking soda, has a wide range of uses. It is commonly used in baking to help the dough rise and create a light texture in baked goods. Additionally, it is often used as a cleaning agent due to its ability to remove stains and odors. Its versatility makes it a staple in many households. It is also regarded as a base and utilized in investigations to study the characteristics of bases.</p>
