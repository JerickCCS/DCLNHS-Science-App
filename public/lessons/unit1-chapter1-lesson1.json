They take many forms, such as three- or two-dimensional objects or diagrams, mathematical equations, and computer simulations. Models are made from established scientific knowledge and observed patterns that allow the prediction of patterns in different conditions or scenarios.\n\nModels generally help explain and understand processes, phenomena, and ideas that are not commonly observed or easily imagined. In many cases, models allow scientists to test ideas and predict outcomes that cannot be easily done in the real world. Models also allow them to test the validity of other existing models.",

    {
      "content": "Scientific models are commonly categorized into **physical**, **conceptual**, **mathematical**, and **computer models**.\n\n**Physical models** are tangible objects that help one understand a concept or process. They are three-dimensional constructed copies of original objects that match their characteristics, such as shape. In some cases, a physical model represents an abstract idea.",

    {
      "content": "Physical models can be life-size replicas or **scale models**, which are smaller than the original objects but otherwise identical. Examples include:\n\n- The globe (represents the Earth)\n- Model of the human skeletal system\n\n<video controls src=\"/videos/physical-models.mp4\"></video>\n\n![Globe model](/img/globe.png)\n\n![Skeleton model](/img/skeleton.png \"Physical models of Earth (globe) and the human skeletal system\")",

      "content": "**Conceptual models** use familiar objects or expressions to present a concept or an abstract and complicated idea. They are also considered *mental models* (Victoria State Government, 2020).\n\nAn example is the **particle model of matter**, which uses round particles to represent the composition of matter to explain their observable properties.",

    {
      "content": "Some conceptual models show systems of ideas and relationships. An example is the **taxonomic classification of organisms**, which displays hierarchical groupings of organisms.\n\nOther models are expressed through writing, speech, or diagrams and are referred to as **expressed models** (Victoria State Government, 2020).\n\n**Examples**\n- Diagrams\n- Flowcharts\n\nFlowcharts show decision options and corresponding outcomes using arrows and shapes.",
